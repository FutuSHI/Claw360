### Content SEO

## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

GEO optimizes content for AI answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini).

### Key GEO Strategies

1. **Cite Sources & Statistics**
   - Include specific numbers, percentages, dates
   - Reference authoritative sources
   - AI engines favor content with verifiable claims

2. **Structured & Scannable Content**
   - Use clear headings, bullet points, tables
   - AI can easily parse and cite structured content
   - FAQ format works well for AI extraction

3. **Authoritative Tone**
   - Write definitively, avoid hedging language
   - Demonstrate expertise with specific details
   - Include author credentials when relevant

4. **Quotable Statements**
   - Create concise, memorable phrases
   - AI often quotes distinctive statements verbatim
   - Use "According to [Source]..." patterns

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Cover topics exhaustively
   - Include related subtopics AI might query
   - Answer the "People Also Ask" questions

6. **Technical Accessibility**
   - Ensure content is crawlable (not behind JS)
   - Fast loading times
   - Clean HTML without excessive ads/popups

### GEO-Specific Tactics

- **Fluency Optimization**: Clear, well-written prose that AI can paraphrase
- **Unique Terminology**: Coin memorable terms that AI will attribute to you
- **Data Tables**: Structured data AI can reference
- **Comparison Content**: "X vs Y" content AI loves to cite
- **Definition Content**: Clear definitions AI will quote

## When Reviewing Content

1. Check meta tags and structured data
2. Analyze keyword placement and density
3. Evaluate content structure for AI parseability
4. Suggest citations and statistics to add
5. Identify quotable statement opportunities
6. Review technical SEO factors

## Output Format
